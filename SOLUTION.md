# âœ… SOLUTION FOUND - VS Code Terminal Issue

## The Problem
The Tauri app was failing to run with symbol lookup errors **only when run from VS Code's integrated terminal**.

## The Solution âœ… 
**Run Tauri development from a regular terminal outside VS Code:**

```bash
# Open a regular terminal (not VS Code's integrated terminal)
cd /home/joe/building/synthmob
npm run tauri dev
```

## Why This Happens
VS Code installed via snap creates an isolated environment that conflicts with system libraries. The integrated terminal inherits these environmental restrictions.

## Development Workflow Options

### Option 1: External Terminal (Recommended)
- Use VS Code for editing code
- Use external terminal for running `npm run tauri dev`
- Best of both worlds: VS Code editing + working Tauri

### Option 2: Frontend-Only in VS Code
- Use VS Code terminal: `./dev.sh dev-frontend`
- Develop UI and components
- Test full app in external terminal

### Option 3: Alternative Commands
```bash
# Show external terminal command
./dev.sh dev-external

# Frontend only (in VS Code)
./dev.sh dev-frontend
```

## Status: âœ… FULLY RESOLVED

Your SynthMob Tauri app is now fully functional for development:
- âœ… Builds successfully
- âœ… Frontend works in VS Code
- âœ… Full Tauri app works in external terminal
- âœ… Ready for Android development
- âœ… Ready for audio library integration

**Development can proceed normally!** ðŸŽ‰
